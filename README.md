Questions
1. Looking at the computed histogram, could it be considered bimodal?
   - Binominal image - is the image that has two distinct peaks. So, in general we can approve that histogram is bimodal!
     
3. Looking at the computed histogram, what binarization threshold would you chose? Why?
   - Looking at the presented histogram, I would choose a threshold around 180 because we can see a peak of bright pixels, 
   - which can be considered as background, and everything below that is darker text. I'm still unclear on how white text 
   - on a dark background would be filtered out in this case; perhaps inversion is used?

5. Looking at the resulting (thresholded) image, is the text binarization (detection) good?
   - Yes, I think the text binarization is enough good.
